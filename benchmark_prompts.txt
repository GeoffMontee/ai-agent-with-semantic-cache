# Long prompts
Can you provide a comprehensive explanation of how modern machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning neural networks, are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, including details about activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques?
I need a detailed breakdown of the differences between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with examples of real-world applications for each approach and explanations of when to use each method.

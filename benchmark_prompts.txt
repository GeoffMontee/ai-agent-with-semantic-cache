Can you explain the complete process of how a modern web application handles a user request from the moment they click a button in their browser through all the network layers, server processing, database queries, and back to rendering the response in the browser, including all intermediate steps and technologies involved?
What are the key differences between monolithic and microservices architectures in terms of deployment, scaling, maintenance, team organization, technology choices, and when would you recommend using one over the other in a real-world enterprise application?
How would you design a highly available, fault-tolerant distributed system that needs to handle millions of requests per second, ensure data consistency across multiple geographic regions, and maintain sub-100ms latency for end users?
Can you provide a comprehensive explanation of how modern machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning neural networks, are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, including details about activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques?
I need a detailed breakdown of the differences between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with examples of real-world applications for each approach and explanations of when to use each method.
Explain the complete lifecycle of a Kubernetes pod from creation to termination, including all the components involved, networking setup, storage mounting, health checks, and what happens during rolling updates and rollbacks.
How does a modern compiler transform source code into executable machine code, including all the phases like lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation, and what are the key differences between JIT and AOT compilation?
Describe the entire process of how HTTPS encryption works from the initial TLS handshake, certificate validation, cipher suite negotiation, key exchange, to the actual encrypted data transmission, and explain how perfect forward secrecy is achieved.
What are all the steps involved in a typical CI/CD pipeline for a containerized microservices application, from code commit to production deployment, including testing, security scanning, image building, orchestration, and monitoring?
Can you explain how modern garbage collectors work in detail, comparing generational garbage collection, mark-and-sweep, copying collection, and concurrent collection algorithms, and discussing their trade-offs in terms of throughput and latency?
How does a distributed database like Cassandra or ScyllaDB handle data distribution, replication, consistency, partition tolerance, and failure recovery, and what are the trade-offs between different consistency levels?
Explain the architecture of a modern search engine including web crawling, indexing, ranking algorithms, query processing, and how techniques like inverted indexes, TF-IDF, and PageRank work together to deliver relevant results?
What is the complete workflow for containerizing and deploying a multi-tier application with Docker and Kubernetes, including Dockerfile optimization, image layers, registry management, pod configuration, service discovery, and ingress setup?
How do modern recommendation systems work, covering collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches, matrix factorization, deep learning models, and how to handle cold start problems and real-time personalization?
Describe the full stack of technologies and protocols involved in video streaming services like Netflix or YouTube, including video encoding, adaptive bitrate streaming, CDN distribution, DRM, and how buffering and quality adaptation work?
Explain the architecture and implementation of a real-time chat application, covering WebSocket connections, message queuing, presence detection, typing indicators, read receipts, message persistence, and scaling to millions of concurrent users?
What are all the security considerations and best practices for building a production web application, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, secure communication, input validation, CSRF/XSS prevention, and security monitoring?
How does blockchain technology work in detail, covering cryptographic hashing, merkle trees, consensus algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, smart contracts, and the trade-offs between decentralization, security, and scalability?
Explain the complete data science workflow from problem definition, data collection and cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection and training, hyperparameter tuning, validation, deployment, and monitoring?
What is involved in building and maintaining a large-scale data pipeline, including data ingestion from multiple sources, ETL processing, data warehousing, real-time streaming, data quality checks, and orchestration with tools like Airflow?
